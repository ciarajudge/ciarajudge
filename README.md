# Hey, my name is Ciara ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a research fellow at the Oxford University, and I work on methods for modelling infectious disease outbreaks that incorporate traditional epidemiology as well as genetic data.

I love software development, maths, biology and science communication, and I try to use my passion for all of these things to make a positive difference in the field of human health. I'm currently working on [EpiFusion](epifusion.org), a program for jointly inferring outbreak trajectories and transmission dynamics by integrating phylodynamics and epidemiology via particle filtering.
